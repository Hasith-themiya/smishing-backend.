## Input Validation

We use Zod to check request data **before** it hits our controllers. If the data is bad, we stop the request and return a HTTP 422. If it is good, we pass it to the controller.

### How it Works
- You write a schema that describes the request body.
- The `validate(schema)` middleware runs first on a route.
- On failure: we send HTTP 422 with along with the errors.
- On success: you get a validated `req.body` in your controller.

### Validate function
The `src\utils\validation\auth.validation.js` file holds the schema and the validate function, currently this file only validates auth routes. The validate function takes a schema as a parameter and uses the schema to allow the data through if it passes the checks, or throw an error if a rule is broken.
Probably don't edit the validate function unless you have a reason to. The schema is below this.

### Writing a Schema
A field schema is set up like this: 

``` JavaScript 
const emailSchema = z
    .string({ required_error: "Email is required." })
    .trim()
    .toLowerCase()
    .refine((e) => /^[^@]+@[^@]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,6}$/.test(e), "Invalid email format."); 
```
<br></br>
An actual endpoint schema is setup like this (these can use the field schemas)
``` JavaScript
export const signupSchema = z
    .object({
        fullName: z // fullName isnt reused anywhere so we just create the field inside the endpoint schema
            .string({ required_error: "fullName is required." })
            .trim()
            .min(1, "fullName is required.")
            .max(100, "fullName too long."),
        phoneNumber: phoneSchema,
        email: emailSchema, // the field schema setup above
        password: passwordSchema,
    })
    .strict();
```
Notice how the email schema is used _within_ the signup schema, the schemas are reusable. 
<br></br>

Now in the routes file you need to pass it through the appropriate validator first.
``` JavaScript
// POST /signup
router.post("/signup", validate(signupSchema), signup);
```
Its important to remove any inline validation in controllers. Controllers should assume the input is already valid.

You also need to take into consideration what validation is going on at the front end. The backend should be at most equally as permissive as the frontend.
